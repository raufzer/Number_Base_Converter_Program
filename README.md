    <h1>ESTIN 1CP term 1 MINI PROJECT</h1>
    <p>A mini project in C to convert a number from one base to another is a good project for introducing students to the basics of working with coding and problem-solving. The program should take two inputs - an input value (in a particular numerical base) and the desired output base. It should then output the converted result. The program should have provisions for different bases, including decimal (base 10), octal (base 8), hexadecimal (base 16) and binary (base 2). Input validation must be included in the program, as well as checking if the output value exceeds the range of values possible in its destination base.</p>
